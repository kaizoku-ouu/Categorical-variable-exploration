# What is a Categorical Variable
- **Definition:** A categorical variable (also known as a qualitative variable) is one that has two or more categories but there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories.\
 **Examples:** Gender (Male, Female), Blood Type (A, B, AB, O).

# What is a Continuous Variable
- **Definition:** A continuous variable is one that can take any value within a range. These values are often measured and can be infinitely precise.\
**Examples:** Height, Weight, Temperature.

# what is a Discrete Variable
- **Definition:** A discrete variable is one that can take only specific values (often integers) and are countable.\
**Examples:** Number of children in a family, Number of cars in a parking lot.

# Why do we need Categorization Variable Exploration
Categorization variable exploration is essential for several reasons:

- Data Understanding: Helps in understanding the distribution and frequency of categories.
- Data Cleaning: It helps in Data Cleaning, identifies inconsistencies, missing values, and errors in categorical data.
- Feature Engineering: Helps in transforming and encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
- Insight Extraction: Provides valuable insights about the relationships between categorical variables and target outcomes.
